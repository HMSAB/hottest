This folder contains all the chunks for implementing the "dut_*" functions
on the "dummyboard" dummy board.

Note that the includes subfolder contains more chunks. On a real scenario this
would allow to reuse some functionality between many boards on the same lab.

Yo can see insde "dummyboard.json" that:

-The "DUMMY_BOARD_ID" environment variable is defined and can be used from the
tests. If you look at

-The "dummyboard" label is defined, so tests can require to be run only on a
 jenkins slave (board) that has this label.
